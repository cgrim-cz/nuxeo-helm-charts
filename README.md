## Nuxeo Helm Chart

/!\ NOT PRODUCTION READY, TESTING PURPOSE ONLY /!\

Even if deploys additional external services ( Mongo, Postgresql, ES, etc) this is not a production ready chart.
The main goal of this chart is to be used a base chart when deploying preview and staging envs on JenkinsX.
The external services referenced by this helm chart have often another version more suitable for production ( for example Redis vs Redis -HA charts)
